In the Elixir trilogy, Clea falls in love with the mysterious Sage only to find it's in her best interest to stay away from him. The two are soulmates who come together in every lifetime, but each one ends in a horrible way for her. She's determined to make this time different, while he's trying to fight his feelings and stay away so she can stay safe.</td>
